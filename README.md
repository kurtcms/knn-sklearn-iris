# Homebrew k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (k-NN) vs scikit-learn's built-in KNeighborsClassifier on the Iris Flower Dataset
This Python script does the following:

1. Builds a homebrew k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN).
2. Uses the homebrew k-NN as well as scikit-learn's built-in KNeighborsClassifier function, to classify the 3 different types of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica), by their sepal length and width, from Ronald Fisher's Iris flower data set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), and measures their accuracies, for k equals to 1 to the number of entries in the Iris flower data set minus 1.
3. Plots the Iris flower data set on prediction grids generated by the homebrew k-NN and scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier, each using a value of k that maximises their respective prediction accuracies.
4. Plots also the prediction accuracies against k of both the homebrew k-NN and scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier for comparison.
